title: JavaScript Knowledge
---
<p>To a beginner like me, the pain of learning how to master JavaScript comes from discovery of endless new things to learn almost everyday, especially those things appear to be loosely connected, of no obvious relation to each other, or belong to no single origin and system (although maybe they have).</p>

<p>I want to take my ability of programming to next level, but I need to admit that I have been very fraustrated for this issue. Therefore I begin this documentation as a experiment. I want to know if recording what I have learned from reading any JavaScript materials and placing them in the most suitable place regarding to each other will relieve the pressure of catching up with the speed of JavaScript knowledge production.</p>

<p>Every entry in this documentation comes with link to its source. The documentation will remain in the state of flux - namely, I will update it continuously. Finally, before the documentation officially begins, I have to say that the system I use to organize knowledge of JavaScript is personal, provisional, and arbitary. Neither does it represent any objectivity of the ultimate JavaScript knowledge (if that exists), nor does it try to become so.</p>
