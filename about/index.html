    <li>
      My educational background is not computer science,
      but I have been a self-starter of <a href="{{ site.url
      }}/js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/web_dev">web development</a> since 2016.
    </li>
    <li>
      I haven't been employed as web developer by any firms yet,
      but I'm determined to persue such career.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most of the time I speak English and JS.
      As a Taiwanese and a web deweller, I also know Chinese and HTML/CSS.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apart from web development, 
      my passion also lies in <a href="{{ site.url }}/diy">DIY</a> 
      and <a href="{{ site.url }}/cooking/">cooking</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In my leisure time I'm addicted to watching YouTube videos which teach people how to cook.
