<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello, I'm Wendy Yuchen Sun (孫語辰). I live in Taipei, Taiwan, and now work as MOE project assistant at Fujen Catholic University (天主教輔仁大學).</p> 

<p>If I can only use one sentence to describe the most significant character of mine, I would say that I like both abstract and pratical knowledge, and I always have endless curiousity for how non-humans around me revolve and operate vividly as coming to life.</p>

<p>I studied politcal science in college, and my past working experience lies mainly in higher education policies. However, interests change as I grow older. Now I spend most of my time focusing on 3 things: web development, cooking at home and reading books regarding to critical theories.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Me and WebDev</b>I began learning web dev out of sheer curiosity of how web and internet work. I have self-learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React.js and coded several sites for friends as side projects in 1 year. Now web deveopment has become my biggest passion in life. I try to sharpen my skills and learn somethings new about web dev every day no matter how tired I get from works in the day time, hoping one day I can officially become a professional.</li>
  <li><b>Me and Cooking at Home</b>In my free time I like to view foodtubes online, and make foods based on videos I have watched. I enjoy the process of comparing different recipes, managing my kitchen with the notion of modulization in mind, and using creativity to decide the combination of produces in meals. Cooking delicious and healthy food is my way to connect to the outer world (ethically), take rest from work and take care of my family.</li>
  <li><b>Me and Critical Theories</b>This is an enduring hobby. It began when I was in college. Critical theories always helps to expand my imagination and scope of how to perceive the world and the society.  I like to reflect on critical theories and the reality, finding chances for the two to debate. I don't study at school now, but I still keep reading critical theories, just for preserving an open and generous mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's basically all about me. Thanks for visiting my website. Apart from the links mentioned above you can also view my GitHub page via the naviagtion bar on top of this page, or contact me by e-mail.</p>
